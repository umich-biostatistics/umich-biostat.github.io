<p>Workshop series with interactive content for learning modern data science and statistics tools. We regularly create and share new content. Stay posted.</p>
<div id="tidyverse-series" class="section level1">
<h1>Tidyverse series</h1>
<p>Tidyverse is a collection of useful R packages for data science tasks. We’ve found them to be helpful, so we created and hosted a workshop series based on them.</p>
<div id="visualize" class="section level3">
<h3>Visualize</h3>
<p>It’s hard to compete with ggplot2 when creating static visuals in R. Check out this interactive tutorial by following the link: <a href="https://umich-biostatistics.shinyapps.io/ggplot2_workshop/">Learn ggplot2</a>.</p>

<div id="high-performance-computing-series" class="section level1">
<h1>High performance computing series</h1>
<p>High performance computing, or HPC, is the process of tackling computationally intensive problems that are too big to run on a personal computer. This series introduces the user to techniques for executing large jobs both from a programming end and from the cluster computing perspective. This combination can lead to significantly improved performance.</p>
